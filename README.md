#MazeRace

This program consists of 2 parts: **Maze generation** and **AI agent search**.

###Maze Generation

The **Whyrm** generates a complete and fully connected maze with rooms and paths between them.

###AI agent search

Two objects are placed into the maze: AI agent and the exit. 
The AI agent uses Search algorythms with hueristic to find a path to the exit.
